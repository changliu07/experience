    "# Assignment 4 Estimating Statistical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due 9 November at 10pm**\n",
    "\n",
    "This NASA post, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/midweek_rainfall.html\">NASA Data Link Pollution to Rainy Summer Days in the Southeast</a>, claims that in the southeastern US it rains more Tuesday through Thursday than it does Saturday through Monday. The presence of a seven-day cycle in the weather is \"eerie\" evidence that human activity influences the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission in this assignment is to see if you can validate their claim using data from the instruments at RDU airport. To quote from the article:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Rainfall measurements collected from ground-based gauges can vary from one gauge site to the next because of fickle weather patterns. So, to identify any kind of significant weekly rainfall trend, Bell and colleagues looked at the big picture from Earth's orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not really equipped to confirm or refute their claim but we're in the southeast, and have some data, let's see what we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have collected 10 years of data into a single file, `krdu-2001-2010.csv`, in a format suitable for use with np.loadtxt(). These data have 4 columns; year, month, day, and rainfall in inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should read these posts by Allen Downey:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html\">There is only one test!</a>\n",
    "2. <a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/06/more-hypotheses-less-trivia.html\">More hypotheses, less trivia.</a> Pay special attention to the paragraph <b>Permutation</b> under <b>Difference in means</b>. You shouldn't use his code; write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to give you more experience writing functions with loops and to expose you to an important use of computers in science.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data.\n",
    "2. Determine the days of the week from the dates. (You can't just slice the array)\n",
    "3. Write a function to get the average daily rainfall during midweek (Tuesday through Thursday) and weekend (Saturday through Monday).\n",
    "4. Report the average rainfall for midweek and weekend, and their difference (delta). I provide a check for this so you can be sure you're on the right track.\n",
    "5. Determine and report the p value (the likelihood that the effect is not real) by simulation. You'll need to first, compute the delta which in our case is the difference between the means for midweek and weekend. Then you'll run the function many times, each time permuting the day labels, and counting the number of times that the difference between the new means is greater than delta. Now divide that count by the number of trials you ran. That will be the p value. If count is 0, that means you didn't find even a single permutation that produced a greater difference in means; the effect is very likely real. On the other hand, if count is huge, then there were many permutations that produced greater differences, so the difference is likely just random.\n"

    "**1)** The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday\"><b>weekday</b></a> method of the <b>date</b> class from the <b>datetime</b> module will be useful for getting the day of the week from the date. **Note:** The `weekday()` method returns `0` for Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The date class knows nothing about numpy so you'll need to use a loop to process all the days. Also your data will be floats but the date function insists on ints; you'll need to use the int() function to convert them to int. \n",

Feel free to play with larger numbers but **I will time limit your submissions and assume they failed if they require more than 30 seconds to run on my computer**. "
